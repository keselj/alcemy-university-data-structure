/* OK, now that we've established a base case, let's add in the recursive step!

Keep walking the nodes until you find the last one. If the node has a node.next, then walk that node:

walk({id: 1, next: {…}}); 
    walk({id: 2, next: {…}}); 
        walk({id: 3, next: {…}}); 
            walk({id: 4, next: undefined}); 
Once you've found the last node (like 4 in this example), return it all the way up the call stack! */

function walk(node) {
    if (node.next === undefined){
        return node}
    return walk(node.next);
